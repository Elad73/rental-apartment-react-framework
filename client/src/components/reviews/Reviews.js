When he discovered there was an issue that could affect the quality of the stay, he immediately communicated it and did everything possible to accommodate us. His place is immaculate and the touches he added to make the guest feels at home are impeccable. <br/>I have not even met Elad and yet I felt his hospitable presence. Thank you! In my book he is a super duper host!"
